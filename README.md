# Game of Words

A text-based android game, where you have to type given words in a limited time. As the game progresses, the size of words increase.

#### How the game works?
* The player starts with 'Level-1'
* The player has to type, five 5-letter words in 30 seconds
* As the player progress the size of words increase but the number of words and given time remains the same
* The final level is 'Level-4' and it has 11-letter words in it
* If the player complete all 4 levels, the player wins the game

This game was developed back in 2016 as a semester project of an Intro to Programming course.
